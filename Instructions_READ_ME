INSTRUCTIONS_READ_ME

Thanks for your interest in using the DXA2. Using the DXA2 for the first time requires three simple steps and we encourage you to read these instructions and watch the corresponding tutorial videos before trying to use the DXA2 for the first time.  Links to the three videos can be found here. 

Step 1- Formatting and exporting your DXA scan reports
Different software versions display and organize DXA data differently. At your DXA computer ensure that the DXA reports to be extracted are formatted correctly. This can be accomplished by changing the report configurations, if needed, as shown in the first tutorial video.

Please scroll to find the software version that matches or is closest to what you are using and ensure your reports are configured to match these examples. Each DXA scan report for use in the DXA2 should be saved to an external hard drive as either an xps or .pdf file. Then, you can either transfer the scans from the external hard drive to a location on the computer where the DXA2 application is located (or will be downloaded) or use the DXA2 on the computer and save all outputs to the external hard drive.

GE Prodigy – enCORE v.12     
GE Prodigy – enCORE v.16      
GE iDXA – enCORE v.17 & 18
Hologic Horizon – Apex v 5.5
Norland ELITE or XR-800 – Illuminatus v. 4.7.5

After your reports have been configured, the DXA reports should be saved using the following file naming convention: 

PatientID_Visit#_ScanType

PatientID: The Patient ID is the number used to identify or index patients. This identifier must be unique to each patient and composed of only letters and numbers (no spaces). There is no character limit for the Patient ID. The Patient ID must be followed by an underscore, “_”.

Visit#: The Visit Number denotes the number of times, or visits, that a patient is scanned using the DXA machine. 
The visit number must be a number but there is no limit to the length. For example, for a pre and post study design, the visit number would be denoted using “1” and “2”. The Visit# must be followed by an underscore, “_”. 

ScanType: Lastly, the Scan Type is the suffix that denotes the type of DXA scan report. See the suffix name for each type of DXA report in Table 1 below.

Step 2 – Downloading and saving the DXA2 application

DXA2 is a standalone application constructed using Python 3.7.  No other software is required to use the DXA2.  The process to download and initialize the DXA2 can also be viewed using the second tutorial video.

On the main webpage (https://github.com/DXA-Data-Xtraction-Assistant/DXA-Data-Xtraction-Assistant) click on the DXA2_DOWNLOAD_ME_V1.exe file in the first box and then click the “Download” button near the middle of the screen in the gray box. Once the DXA2 has finished downloading, you will find the application in your “Downloads” folder. The DXA2 can be moved to another location on your computer or hard drive by dragging and dropping (or by using the cut and paste functions). If you have issues, please review the troubleshooting/FAQ’s at the end of these instructions.  


Step 3- Using the DXA2 application

Once you have successfully downloaded the DXA2, it is time to use it! Double click the DXA2 .exe file (femur icon) or right click and select “Run as Administrator”. The first time you open DXA2, it may take a minute or two to load. After the initial use, the DXA2 will load faster. You will be greeted by an introduction page that provides a link to the GitHub site. We encourage you to read all of these written instructions and view all three tutorial videos prior to using the DXA2. 

Although the DXA2 is free, the developers request that users cite the DXA2 in their publications using the following citation: Include citation here
After selecting “I agree”, you will be prompted to select the manufacturer and the software version for your DXA machine. As noted in the DXA2, if you do not see the specific software version for your DXA machine, please try all the other software versions first. 

Once, you have selected your software version, you will select the input, or file path to your properly saved DXA reports, and the output folder, or file path for where the extracted data should be saved. Once you have selected the input folder, output folder, and clicked “transform”, you need to select what types of DXA reports you have available and would like to extract data from. After selecting these using the checkboxes, select “merge”. After this has been completed, the final screen will thank you for using the DXA2 and will remind users to cite our work. If you have any issues with using the DXA2, please review the troubleshooting/FAQ’s below or the third tutorial video.

Tips for success: 1) Ensure that your input folder ONLY includes the properly configured and formatted DXA reports (.pdf or .xps files). If any of these files are improperly named for use in the DXA2 or if there are other files in the input folder, the DXA2 will not work. 2) It is helpful for the first few times using the DXA2 to have your output file folder empty, prior to transformation and merging, so you can recognize all the output and its organization. 


Troubleshooting/FAQ’s

Formatting and Exporting your DXA scan reports

Can I name my scans whatever I want? No. The patient or participant ID’s can be any alphanumeric sequence but cannot contain spaces. The naming format for each DXA report is PatientID_Visit#_ScanType. This format is how the DXA2 will correctly identify, transform, and merge your DXA report data. As noted in our publication, the time required to reconfigure and/or resave DXA reports using this format is minimal but is a necessary step to successfully use the DXA2.

I did a scan not listed in Table 1 and don’t know how to save it. The DXA machine has a variety of capabilities (e.g. aortic calcification) not listed in Table 1 in the instructions. If this is the case, please email the administrator at DXA2@health.missouri.edu and they will work with you directly. 

Why can’t I just do Steps 1-3 on my DXA computer? Most DXA manufactures discourage users from connecting their DXA computer to the internet. However, if your DXA computer is internet-enabled, you can follow steps 2 and 3 on your DXA computer. If your DXA computer is not connected to the internet, be sure to move all reconfigured and/or renamed DXA reports (.xps or .pdf files) to an external hard drive for transport to your Windows computer of choice.

Can I share this resource and do I need to pay for something? The DXA2 is free to use and share. The DXA2 was created to save time, eliminate errors, and expand the amount of DXA data available for use without associated increased costs. We encourage you to share the DXA2 with your colleagues. All that we require is that the DXA2 is properly cited when utilizing data extracted using the DXA2 (include our citation). 

Downloading and Saving DXA2

Why is this not working on my Mac? Currently the DXA2 does not work on Apple products.

When I try to open DXA2, Microsoft Defender stops me from running the application. The first time you download and use the DXA2, click “More info” and then click “Run anyway”. 
My computer tells me: This app can’t run on your PC. If this is the case, try reopening the DXA2 by right clicking and selecting “Run as an administrator”.  Then select “yes” to run and open the application.

I can’t find the download file (.exe file). Navigate to your downloads folder and search there. If the DXA2 is not located there, return to the GitHub site and retry downloading. Ensure you don’t have any pop-up blockers inhibiting the download.
Using the DXA2 application

When I click “transform” or “merge”, I don’t get a confirmation box/nothing happens. This can mean one of two things. First, double check that you ONLY have .pdf or .xps files in the input folder and check that all DXA scans are named using the correct format for the DXA2 (see Table 1). Even one mistake in the file name will prevent the DXA2 from working. Second, if your reports are not configured properly or you selected the wrong manufacture/software version for your reports, the DXA2 won’t be able to read your DXA scans. As noted in the instructions and the tutorial videos, if your DXA software version is not listed, please email the DXA2 administrator at DXA2@health.missouri.edu and we will work with you directly. 

In my data files (either merged or abbreviated), I am missing data. Be sure to double check that the report containing that data was correctly named using the DXA2 format. For instance, if you saved the radial scans as “_Radius” instead of “_Rad”, the DXA2 will not retrieve those data. 
How do I know what these abbreviated variable names mean? In your output folder, you will find a data dictionary that lists all variables and their abbreviations.

I need data from a report not listed. If you have data that is not extracted by the DXA2, please email the DXA2 administrator at DXA2@health.missouri.edu and we will work with you directly.
